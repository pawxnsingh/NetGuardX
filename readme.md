### Introduction

>A web application firewall (WAF) is used to protect web applications against web based attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). The WAF sits in-front of our web server and monitors all the incoming traffic to the server from the client side before passing it on to the actual server. The WAF protects the applications against any form of attacks in such a way that it detects and blocks any malicious requests, while allowing regular requests to pass through transmitting it to the web-server.


### Python based Packet Filtering Firewall Application.

>Packet filtering is a firewall technique used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, protocols and ports and using ML on top that.
